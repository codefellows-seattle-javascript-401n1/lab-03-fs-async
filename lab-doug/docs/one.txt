For this assignment you will need to read three files and console log the first 8 bytes in hex of each file.
Also, you must guarantee that three files are read and console logged in the order 'one.txt', 'two.txt', 'three.txt' regardless of file size.
You can use any method of handling async except nested callback. aka. dont use nested calls to fs.readFile with anynomus function callbacks
You will need to write tests that gaurantee that the files are logged in order.
You will also need to look up and implement async testing, making sure that you are not getting "false positives"(tests that are passing but shouldn't be).
