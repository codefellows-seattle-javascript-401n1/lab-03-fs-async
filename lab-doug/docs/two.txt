Description:

copy your lab-youname directory from the lab-01-modular-patterns assignment into the fork of this assignment

For this assignment you will add a gulpfile and a package.json file to your previous assignment.

The package.json file should include all the dependencies and dev devpendencies for the project.

The gulpfile should contain a task to run the mocha/assert test as well as run eslint on all of your code. This should include your tests and your gulpfile.

Bonus:

For an extra point, set up a watch task that reruns your tests/eslint on changes to any of your files (minus package.json)
HINT: read the gulp docs :)
For another bonus point move the eslint options out of your eslint rc and into gulp
